# Job-Task-Automation
This repository is a collection of a few scripts, macros, and apps that were designed to automate certain repetitive job tasks for myself and coworkers. The biggest project, a Warranty/Lease expiry updating app is still a work in progress, but I plan to add it, as well as some additional smaller projects as soon as they are completed, which should hopefully be soon.

Each folder contains an additional README.txt file for additional information about the specific project. Please refer to those for more specific documentation.
