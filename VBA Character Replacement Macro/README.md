# VBA Character Replacement Macro

This file replaces accented and Non English characters with their English equivelants. 

The macro consists of two modules. The one called, LoadRemoveDiacriticsTables, which contains all of the targeted characters, and their English replacements. The second module, main.vba, contains the logic to target the workbook.

I found the code on a code sharing website, and have modified it for my organizations usages, however, I will be making additional changes so that it replaces the characters in the entire excel sheet, rather than just a specific row, which is currently how it is configured.
